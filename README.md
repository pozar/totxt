Convert text files created on different OSs to the native newline, etc conventions

I wrote this back in the '80s when I was moving my files from my CP/M box to MS-DOS and wanted to support the newline conventions and WordStar formating.  I still use it on occasion but there are other progams out there such as sed and tr that can convert newlines.
